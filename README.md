# cmdline-course
This is the final assingment for the course unit KIK-LG221 "Command Line Tools for Linguists" (5 cr). The aim of the course, among other things, was to  
* teach the students how to use Unix command-line and regular expressions
* introduce the students to basic processing of corpora 
* create and host a webpage on GitHub Pages
* **stay calm** and <ins>google</ins> when things go wrong  

The course material for each week was published on the course's Moodle page on Monday. The students had until Sunday to finish the week's quiz and to upload their homework.

## Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments  
This week involved **setting up and launching the command-line in Windows and MacOS** as well as going through **basic command line commands**.

Commands introduced: ls, pwd, whoami, wget, mv, cat, less, cp, rm, mkdir, cd, q, Esc, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-d, Ctrl-x, nano

I had some difficulty setting up Ubuntu on my Windows 11. Oftentimes, I had to install some additional files before I could get the commands to work. Thankfully, Ubuntu usually told me directly what command I should use to get the files I needed. Any remaining issues were solved by googling.  
## Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System  
This week's material had to do with **copying, moving and renaming directories, process management**, and **how to connect and work in a remote server**.

Commands introduced: cp -R, rm -R, rmdir, which, top, &, fg, CTRL+Z, ps, kill, ssh, scp

I managed to get through this week's material with relative ease. Setting up the CSC remote server access was a little cumbersome but manageable. No extra googling needed:smile:

## Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing 
This week's material had to do with **using text processing tools in UNIX, and regular expressions and the grep commands to search through lines in a text file**, as well as working with **formatted text files**. 

Commands introduced: file, dos2unix, iconv, tr, sort, uniq, egrep with -w, -f, csv and tsv formats, cut

This is the point where the material started getting more challenging. If I hadn't already been learning about regular expressions in another course, I probably would have struggled more. The puzzles were fun though:grin: 
## Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing
This week's focus was on **combining simple commands into more complex command pipelines** and **the _sed_ command**

Commands introduced: sed with -n, -E, //d, //p, s//g

This was the week that I struggled the most. Doing the quiz made me realize I had yet to fully internalized the contents of this or the previous week. Consequently, I had to google a lot and ended up trying many different solutions without fully understanding what I was doing half the time:sweat_smile: I also felt like I ran out of time towards the end, although that's mainly due to poor time management. Looking back though, I think this week was essential to my learning process, as going through the correct solutions and trying them for myself made me think about what I was doing wrong and really dig into the material. 
## Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files

Commands introduced: chmod u+x, if, $?, $#, printenv, echo, export, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, source, alias
## Week 6: Installing and Running Programs
## Week 7: Version Control 
## Final Assignment
